                                    <p>Our Employee Development company policy refers to the company’s learning and development programs and activities.

                                        In the modern competitive environment, employees need to replenish their knowledge and acquire new skills to do their jobs better. This will benefit both them and the company. We want them to feel confident about improving efficiency and productivity, as well as finding new ways towards personal development and success.
                                        Scope
                                        
                                        This policy applies to all permanent, full-time or part-time, employees of the company. Employees with temporary/short-term contracts might attend trainings at their manager’s discretion.
                                        
                                        This policy doesn’t cover supplementary employees like contractors or consultants.
                                        Policy elements
                                        
                                        Employees, managers and Human Resources (HR) should all collaborate to build a continuous professional development (CPD) culture. It’s an employee’s responsibility to seek new learning opportunities. It’s a manager’s responsibility to coach their teams and identify employee development needs. And it’s HR’s
                                         responsibility to facilitate any staff development activities and processes.</p>
